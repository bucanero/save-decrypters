- 0x0~0x3 = Integer_1, Magic
- 0x4~0x7 = Integer_2, Version1 (0x1A=26 or 0x1B=27)
- 0x8~0xB = Integer_3, Length of Secure Block
- 0xC~0xF = Integer_4, Length of Secure Block + Version
- 0x10~0x13 = Integer_5, Checksum(Sum32) of Secure Block
- 0x14~0x17 = Integer_6, Version2 (0x06 or 0x07)
- 0x18~0x37 = Blob_1, HMACSHA1(0x14), Integer_7, Long_1 [encrypted]
- 0x38~0x3B = Integer_7, Salt (The manipulated Nanoseconds Part of Time/Date) 
- 0x3C~0x43 = Long_1, Time/Date (Unixtime Integer only the other Part is 0)
- 0x44~Integer_3 = Blob_2, Secure Block [encrypted]
- After the Secure Block file is padded with 0x00

Notes:
Integer_7 can NOT be calculated back the manipulation is oneway and not reversible
and because of that it is impossible for nobody to check if it is the original or not.
Which means you can put there what you want after decryption as long as you change both,
it will remain valid, because not even the Game can know what was the original Value and
will simply read what is there and use it as a part of a Salt.
